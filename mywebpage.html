        Hi, milu . I think you are well. I'm going to share my future plan. You
        already have known I'm strongly motivated to build my career in the
        development areas and I want to be a full stack web developer. I know
        development is not a cup of tea üçµ but except if you always beside to me
        through my journey it would be like a lion's power in my own!
      </p>

      <p class="para-two">
        I also believe in hard work with strong dedication and proper direction!
        There goes several proverb that i believe, "where there is a will there
        is a way" "When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let
        go." "There is nothing impossible to they who will try." ... "The bad
        news is time flies.... "Life has got all those twists and turns. "Keep
        your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you."
